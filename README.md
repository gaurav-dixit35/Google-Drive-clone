Project Title: Google Drive Clone (Frontend UI)
Overview: This project is a front-end replica of the Google Drive web interface, built using HTML, CSS (with Materialize CSS framework), and JavaScript. It recreates the visual structure and layout of Google Drive, emphasizing UI components, responsive design, and user-centric styling to deliver a familiar cloud storage experience.

Technologies Used:

HTML5 – Semantic structure and content organization

CSS3 / Materialize CSS – Styling and component framework

JavaScript (Optional) – Can be extended for interactive features

Hosted Assets – Uses CDN for Materialize and Google Fonts

Purpose: This static UI clone serves as a front-end learning project to practice layout building, responsive design, and theming using Materialize CSS. It’s suitable for demonstrating UI/UX design capabilities or as a base for further development into a full-stack cloud storage application.
